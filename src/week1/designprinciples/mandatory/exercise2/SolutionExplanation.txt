1.Understanding Asymptotic Notation:
Big O notation describes how an algorithmâ€™s running time grows with input size.
Linear Search:
O(n) Time Complexity
Binary Search:
O(log n) Time Complexity

2.Suitable Algorithm:
For this particular problem, since our goal is to achieve efficiency we can use Binary Search.
